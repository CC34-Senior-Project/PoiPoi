      "This work, commissioned to mark the 10th anniversary of Roppongi Hills and the Mori Art Museum, is poised over the Mohri Garden pond, which is rich in history. This installation is a string of gold-leaf beads that describe the arc of a heart. As one walks around the Mohri Pond, the sculpture gradually takes on the appearance of a MÃ¶bius strip. Artist JEAN-MICHEL OTHONIEL wants viewers to experience nature in Japan as it changes through the seasons and the pageant of history embodied in Mohri Garden, a history that stretches all the way back to the Edo period.",
